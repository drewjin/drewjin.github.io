<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello there! My name is Yijie Jin (Èáë‰πâÊù∞). I am currently an undergraduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University (SHU), supervised by Prof. [Junjie Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=l7IPf0sAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My English name is **Drew**. In English-speaking contexts, I prefer to use Drew as my middle name, so my full name can be Yijie Drew Jin. Feel free to address me by any of these names‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs Yijie, Drew, or Jin‚ÄîI'm happy to respond to any of them!

I am passionate about advancing **Machine Learning Systems (MLSys)**, with a strong focus on **Efficient Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Additionally, I used to explore **traditional NLP** and **multimodal learning**, particularly in the domain of **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA)**. My first paper, which integrates these research areas (both MLSys and MSA), has been submitted to **ACL 2025** and is currently under review, with a meta score 4 in ARR Dec. Round.

Recently,

- I have been serving as a Research Intern with Prof. [Zhijie Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J3dR0sUAAAAJ&hl=en) at Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), diving into Edge LLM deployment with all sorts of LLM reasoning & inference optimization.

- Currently learning all kinds of stacks: 
  - **Lang**: Triton, CPP (keeps on learning, diving in), Golang in backend development, Vue in frontend development.
  - **MLSys/Efficient LLMs**: parallel decoding, efficient reasoning, kv compression, etc. (hard! hard! hard!)
  - **LLM Reasoning**: all kinds of reasoning tasks, especially reasoning pruning.

- Planning to learn: Ray, TileLang, practice my leetcode ablitiy, etc.

- Projects planning to work on: minitorch.
