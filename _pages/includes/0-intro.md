Hello there! My name is Yijie Jin (金义杰). I am currently an undergraduate student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology, School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University (SHU), supervised by Prof. [Junjie Peng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=l7IPf0sAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My English name is **Drew**. In English-speaking contexts, I prefer to use Drew as my middle name, so my full name can be Yijie Drew Jin. Feel free to address me by any of these names—whether it’s Yijie, Drew, or Jin—I'm happy to respond to any of them!

I am passionate about advancing **Machine Learning Systems (MLSys)**, with a strong focus on **Efficient Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Additionally, I used to explore **traditional NLP** and **multimodal learning**, particularly in the domain of **Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA)**. My first paper, which integrates these research areas (both MLSys and MSA), has been submitted to **ACL 2025** and is currently under review, with a meta score 4 in ARR Dec. Round.

Recently,

- I have been serving as an intern with Prof. [Zhijie Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J3dR0sUAAAAJ&hl=en) at Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), diving into Edge LLM deployment with all sorts of LLM reasoning & inference optimization.
